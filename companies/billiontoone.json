  "description": "Developer of a molecular counter platform intended to increase the resolution of cell-free DNA testing. The company's pan-cancer tumor-naive oncology test precisely quantifies tumor burden from a blood sample to track response to therapy and its prenatal testing procedure focuses on quantitative biology and statistical learning methods to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio and detect single-gene disorders, enabling expecting mothers to detect disorders such as sickle-cell disease, beta-thalassemia, spinal muscular atrophy, and cystic fibrosis through a simple blood test.",
